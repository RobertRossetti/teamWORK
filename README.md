# How to install the server

Before you do this: Note that there have been issues installing Nunjucks
on the VM. I recommend doing this on your main operating system since it'll
run just as well there.

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
cd folder/where/I/want/the/repo
git clone https://github.com/mrjacobbloom/teamWORK.git
```

2. [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
3. [Install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
4. Navigate into the `code` folder:

```shell
cd code
```

5. Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

# How to run the server

1. Navigate into the `code` folder:

```shell
cd code
```

2. Start the server:

```shell
node index.js
```
